                        minimum requirement of 50% female participation in each team, to ensure and promote women’s
                        participation in tech and tech-related events.

                        We have been organising Women Techies for the past 2 years with a goal to encourage and
                        facilitate the participation of women in the tech space. Succeeding in tech is no easy task,
                        but, by providing women with opportunities and platforms to exhibit their skills, we hope to put
                        them right at the top of the leaderboard. Knowing that our efforts benefit so many talented
                        women and being able to see the satisfaction on our participant’s faces makes all of us
                        extremely proud in the work that we do.
